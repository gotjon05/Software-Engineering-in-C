Problem: 
	Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the lenght of arbitrary long input lines and as much as possible of text

Understanding what the problem is asking me 
	store as much as you can up to MAXLINE characters, but you keep reading after that limit just for the purpose of counting.

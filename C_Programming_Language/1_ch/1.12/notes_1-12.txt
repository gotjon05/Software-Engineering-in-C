I forgot to consider the order of operations when using getchar()
	I inititially used: while(c = getchar() != EOF){
		This does not print anything because it reads right to left and EOF is read before getchar. 

	Solution: while((c = getchar()) != EOF){
		I needed to give getchar a parenthesis, the highest order of operations to insure that its called first

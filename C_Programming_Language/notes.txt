2.3
	String constant/string literal ("i am string") vs. character constant ('x')
		string constant
			-sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes, quotes serve to delimit it. 
			-technically an array of characters with null character '/0' at the end 
		

		Character Constant 
			-integer used to produce the numeric values of the letter x in the machines character set
			-written as one character within single quotes. the value of the character constant is the 
			numeric values of the character in the machines character set
			-often used in comparisons with other characters 


2.4 Declarations
	Declarations
		What it is
			specifies a type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type
	
		Purpose
			-to declare variables before use
	Initialization 
		What is it
			Replacing a variables initial garbage value with a non-garbage value 
		How it works
			if the name is followed by an equal sign and an expression, the expression serves as an 
			initializer

		explicit initialization of automatic variable	

		initialization of external and static variables


2.6 Relational and Logical Operators

	relational operators have lower precedence that arithmetic operators
		example
			i < lim-1  == i < (lim-1)	

	logical operators
		How are they evaluated
			evaluated left to right and evaluation stops as soon as the truth or falsehood of result


	Example

		Original.		for(i=0; i <lim-1 && (c =getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i)
						s[i] = c;

		1.			(i < lim-1) 
				why is it evaluated first?
					evaluated left to right and relational operator has lower precedence than 
					arithmatic operation

				Purpose of evaluating it first within program
					Because its neccisary to check that there is room to store in array s 
					before reading a new character

		2. 			(c =getchar())
				why is it evaluated first within program
					parenthesis has highest 
				Purpose of evaluating it first within program
					we need to call getchar before c is tested. To avoid testing c with equality operators which have 
					higher priority than assignments, we use parenthesis to elevate priority


2.7 Type Conversion
	What is type conversion
		character transformations, where operands of different types are changed to a common type 
	How does it happen
		through the interaction with an operator 
	
	Examples of Char to int
		Chars
			its a small integer so able to be used in arithmetic expressions 
			s[i] - 0 gives the numeric value of character stored in s[i]

2.8 Increment and Decrement Operators
	increment via postfix vs prefix
		pre-fix (++n)
			increments n before value is used
			x = ++n  --> sets x to 6

		postfix (n++) 
			increments n after value is used	
			x = n++ --> sets x to 5
